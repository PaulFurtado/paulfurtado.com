            <h1>Paul Furtado</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a Computer Science major at Northeastern University and a
                software developer at VMware. I like Python, JavaScript, Volvo
                S60's, hamburgers, micro controllers, and caffeine.
            </p>
            <h3>At VMware</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a core member of the vCloud Director infrastructure
                team, where I work on bringing the fastest possible virtual
                infrastructure deployments and the tools and API's to use
                them to the rest of the vCloud development team and the vCloud
                QE team. Here you'll typically find me writing Python and
                JavaScript, managing virtual infrastructure, and debugging
                ridiculous software errors caused by over-utilized hardware and
                nested virtualization.
            </p>
            <h3>At Northeastern</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a middler (the year between sophomore and junior year) and
                you can find me at <a href="http://hacks.io/">NUHacks</a> every
                Thursday.
            </p>
            <h3>In my own time</h3>
            <p>
                I play with micro controllers, LEDs, big speakers, debian,
                android, low-power computers, and the computer in my car.
            <p>
